# GenKey Project README

Welcome to the GenKey Project by Ivan. This project showcases examples of key generation for SSH, GitHub, and PEM keys, aimed at facilitating secure communications and integrations.

## Quick Start

1. **SSH Keys**: For secure shell access, ensuring encrypted network communication.
2. **GitHub Keys**: For secure git operations, enabling verified commits and secure repository operations.
3. **PEM Keys**: For securing web communications, used in SSL certificates and HTTPS.

Each directory typically includes a Makefile to generate keys and sample programs in C or Python demonstrating how to use these keys for encrypted communications.

Explore the examples to understand the utility and application of each type of key in your projects.
